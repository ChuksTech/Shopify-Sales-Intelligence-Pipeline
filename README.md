# Shopify-Sales-Intelligence-Pipeline
Built a data pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes Shopify e-commerce data to surface key business insights such as revenue trends, product performance, customer segmentation, and operational bottlenecks.
📦 Shopify Sales Intelligence Pipeline
🧠 Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering solution using real-world e-commerce data from Shopify. It covers data ingestion, transformation, and visualization to enable key business decisions around sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory trends.

🔧 Tech Stack
Python – API integration, data transformation

Shopify API – Data source (orders, products, customers)

PostgreSQL / Snowflake – Data storage and querying

Apache Airflow – Workflow orchestration

dbt (Data Build Tool) – SQL-based transformations & modeling

Metabase / Power BI – Dashboarding and insights

Docker / GitHub Actions (optional) – Deployment & CI/CD

🛠️ Key Steps
1. Data Ingestion
Authenticate with Shopify API using Python

Fetch and store data from:

Orders endpoint

Products endpoint

Customers endpoint

Save raw JSON locally or in a cloud bucket

2. Data Storage
Load raw data into PostgreSQL (or Snowflake)

Design schema: raw_orders, raw_customers, raw_products

3. Data Transformation (ELT)
Use SQL or dbt to clean and join datasets

Create dimension tables:

dim_customers, dim_products

Create fact tables:

fact_orders, fact_order_items

4. Orchestration
Use Airflow to schedule daily ingestion and transformation

Define tasks: fetch → load → transform → notify

5. Dashboarding
Build visual reports (e.g., Metabase, Power BI):

Revenue over time

Best-selling products

High-value customers

Inventory turnover

Daily sales snapshot

📊 Sample KPIs You Can Track
Total Revenue by Month

Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Average Order Value (AOV)

Repeat Purchase Rate

Inventory Stockout Rate

Conversion Funnel (Add to cart → Purchase)

🚀 Bonus Features (Stretch Goals)
Implement data quality checks with Great Expectations

Detect anomalies in sales with a basic model

Add CI/CD with GitHub Actions + Docker

Deploy to GCP/AWS with scheduled Cloud Functions or Lambda

💼 Business Impact
“This pipeline surfaces the metrics a growth team, product manager, or operations lead would use to make decisions — whether that’s identifying top-selling products, optimizing inventory restocks, or tracking high-value customers over time.”
